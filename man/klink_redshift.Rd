\description{
Enables users to create connections to Kellogg redshift databases

In order to use these tools users must first:
\enumerate{
\item Have a RStudio Connect account (you likely have one already if you're using RStudio Workbench, if not you can request access through Digital Concierge).
\item Create a local RStudio Connect API key \url{https://docs.rstudio.com/connect/user/api-keys}
\item Create an .Renviron file in your Home folder assigning your API key value to the name CONNECT_API_KEY \url{https://rstats.wtf/r-startup.html}
}
}
\examples{
conn <- klink_redshift(environment = "DEV")

DBI::dbListTables(conn)
DBI::dbGetQuery(con, "SELECT TOP 10 * FROM fin_acctg_ops.fisc_cal_wk")
}
