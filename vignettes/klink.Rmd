## What it's for
The goal of klink is to provide helpful functions for Kellogg users to form connections to common data sources.

## Setup
In order to use these tools users must first:

1. Have an RStudio Connect account (you likely have one already if you're using RStudio Workbench, if not you can request access through Digital Concierge, instructions can be found here: <https://rstudioconnect.analytics.kellogg.com/RStudio_Knowledge_Library/>)
2. Create a local RStudio Connect API key <https://docs.rstudio.com/connect/user/api-keys>
3. Create an .Renviron file in your Home folder assigning your API key value to the name CONNECT_API_KEY <https://rstats.wtf/r-startup.html>

## How to Install
Currently, the easiest way to install the klink package is to install from the public GitHub repo:
```{r install, eval=FALSE, include=TRUE}
devtools::install_github("mikechappelow/klink")

library(klink)
```

In the future we will host these types of packages in our internal RStudio Package Manager environment.

## Current Functions

### klink functions
The klink functions can be used to establish links to common data sources within Kellogg.

#### klink_sql
The klink_sql function enables users to link to predefined, internal SQL databases using only a couple of arguments and removes the necessity of locally defining service account credentials in your code, .Renviron files, and Connect publications.

Example:

```{r klink_sql, eval=FALSE, include=TRUE}
library(klink)

conn <- klink_sql("DEV", "KG_ANALYTICS_APPS")

DBI::dbGetQuery(conn,
          "SELECT TOP 5
          fixer_number, service_provider
          FROM dbo.GBS_Performance_Metrics;")
```

Note: the klink_sql function requires the odbc and DBI R packages.

#### klink_s3
The klink_s3 function enables users to link to our kortex s3 bucket simply by calling the function (no arguments required).

Note: this particular function is still in development due to inconsistencies in the behavior of the AWS iam behavior.

```{r klink_s3, include=TRUE}
# library(klink)
# 
# # Retrieve required system settings (in background) and appropriate s3 bucket name
# klink_s3()
# 
# # Use aws.s3 functions to retrieve information from s3 bucket
# # (making sure to reference the bucket as "s3BucketName_kortex")
# aws.s3::get_bucket_df(s3BucketName_kortex,max = 20)[["Key"]]
```

#### klink_s3R
The klink_s3R function enables users to link to our foreign s3 bucket simply by calling the function (no arguments required).

Example:

```{r klink_s3R, include=TRUE}
library(klink)

# Retrieve required system settings (in background) and appropriate s3 bucket name
klink_s3R()

# Use aws.s3 functions to retrieve information from s3 bucket
aws.s3::object_exists("your_object.rds", bucket = s3BucketName)
aws.s3::object_size("your_object.csv", bucket = s3BucketName)
```


### zoltar

![](zoltar-hex.png){width=216px}

The klink functions are essentially wrappers that utilize zoltar to make the user experience as frictionless as possible. This is achieved by leveraging the zoltar API and making assumptions about the connection that should be formed based on the user inputs.

If you would like to avoid these assumptions while leveraging the underlying functionality you can do so by specifying your own connection settings and using the zoltar function directly in your connection call.

When a wish/alias of a known value is passed to this function our internal zoltar API returns the requested value. 

If there are required connections that are not yet supported by zoltar please reach out to the Kellogg Data Science team to have them added.

Example:
```{r zoltar, include=TRUE}
library(klink)

con <- DBI::dbConnect(
          odbc::odbc()
          ,Driver = "freetds"
          ,Server = zoltar("server_alias") 
          ,Database = "database_name"
          ,UID = zoltar("uid_alias")
          ,PWD = zoltar("pwd_alias")
          )
```

Note: the values passed to the zoltar function in the example above are not valid and are meant for illustrative purposes only. Please contact a member of the data science team if you have questions concerning valid arguments for zoltar.
